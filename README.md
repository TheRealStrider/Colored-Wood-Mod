# Colored-Wood-Mod
The Colored Wood Mod adds in wooden planks that are colored from dyes in Minecraft.
Make bleach and apply it to any wooden plank to create bleached wood.
From there you can apply any dye you want.

This is a remake of the older versions of my mod. The previous version was made for 1.15.2 and I used Intelij to create it.
The first ever version was for 1.11.2 where I used Mcreator. This remake will be for Minecraft version 1.18.2 and possibly 1.19.2.
